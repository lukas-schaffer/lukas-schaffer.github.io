## Self improvement is easy (If you are good at lying)
(And oh boy am i good at lying)

### Motivation
You may be asking yourself, what does this title mean? Answer: Exactly what it says. Self-Improvement is a hard and arduous journey if you take it seriously. It is one of the most rewarding virtues one can strife for. Which is why i am going to completely ignore it and code some things that i can improve instead of myself for all the good feelings and less of the hard work!

*(Honest Answer: The main purpose of this blog is to improve my skills at documenting and defining my work and maybe improve my work ethic, but that's a less catchy title)*
### Material
So we got all the best ingredients for a subpar blog on our hands: A Person with too much time and not enough ability to value it correctly, who at this time needs to code every now and then to feel validated enough to not completely doubt their own skills in life. 
Now that we got the ingredients lined up, lets start cooking:

**Recipe:**
+ 1x Github as a Hoster and CI/CD Platform
+ 1x Modern Web-framework that is completely overkill for a simple static blog (Astro)
+ 1x Person with a free evening.

### Agenda
Getting started, i wish i could say that i did everything myself and that i worked myself to the bone, but the theme i am using has one of the best and easiest setup tutorials i have ever seen, so will just link it to you [here](https://astro-blog-zozo.pages.dev/posts/getting-started).

The only changes i made to this recipe were as follows:
1. Removing the japanese and chinese posts and defaults as i sadly am not fluent enough to use them with the respect they deserve.
2. Removing all socials except for the XML-Feed, Github and **Twitter** ( I am going to call it Twitter until the Day i die, without even glancing at the self-absorbed megalomaniac currently at that ships helm).
3. Changed giscus to work for me (For now you need a github account to comment, maybe i will change it in the future, but for now this is good enough).
4. Last but not least, it took an embarassingly long time (40 min) for me to realize that the search results were not in chinese because somehow this template loved its original creator and refused to bow to my basic european linguistics, but instead that because this is an **offline index** (On this Note, please check out [Astro Pagefind](https://chrispennington.blog/blog/pagefind-static-search-for-astro-sites/), it really is a marvellous piece of software), it needs to be rebuilt on every blog post and change to titles and tags. Which is totally reasonable, just apparently not immediatly understandable for my brain that somehow missed the **offline** part. But hey, we live and we learn.
### Coda
Seeing as i talked about the most important things and set up my Blog in the meantime, i am confident to wrap the first post up here. There is no writing schedule as i cannot predict when the muse will strike me next (translation: when i will have my next spontaneous bout of motivation and / or procrastionation that enables me to write more than two coherent sentences). But i have to say, I understand the appeal of writing about one's progress, really helps to put things into perspective. And also its fun.
